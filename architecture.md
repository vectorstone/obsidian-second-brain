# obsidian-second-brain — Complete Architecture Document

## Purpose
Generate a visual architecture diagram (Mind Map, Infographic, or Slide Deck) of this system. This document describes every component, how they connect, and how data flows through the system.

---

## System Overview

obsidian-second-brain is a Codex skill that turns an Obsidian vault into a personal AI operating system. As of v0.5: 6 layers, 31 slash commands, 4 scheduled agents, 1 background agent, a research toolkit (Grok + Perplexity + YouTube), and a central config file (AGENTS.md) that ties everything together. Section 0 of `AGENTS.md` enforces the AI-first vault rule — every note is designed for future-agent retrieval, not human reading.

---

## Core Architecture

### Entry Point: AGENTS.md
- Lives at the vault root
- Read by every Claude surface on session start (Codex and compatible agent surfaces)
- Contains: folder structure map, naming conventions, frontmatter schemas, propagation rules, active context, kanban format rules
- Acts as the operating manual — no memory needed between sessions
- Updated by user or by /obsidian-init command

### Connection Layer: MCP Server (mcp-obsidian)
- Bridges Claude to the Obsidian vault
- Provides tools: get_file_contents, list_files_in_vault, search, append_content, write_file
- Fallback: direct filesystem read/write if MCP unavailable

---

## Layer 1: Vault Operations (14 commands)

Purpose: Automated vault management — saving, organizing, searching, maintaining.

### Commands and Data Flow:

   - PROPAGATION: Updates kanban boards + today's daily note

2. **/obsidian-daily** — Daily note management
   - INPUT: Today's date + conversation context
   - PROCESS: Reads Templates/Daily Note.md, fills in sections
   - OUTPUT: Creates/updates Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md

3. **/obsidian-log** — Dev/work session logging
   - INPUT: Conversation context (infers project)
   - PROCESS: Reads Templates/Dev Log.md, fills in work done, problems, decisions, next steps
   - OUTPUT: Creates Dev Logs/YYYY-MM-DD — Project Name.md
   - PROPAGATION: Links from project note (Recent Activity) + daily note

4. **/obsidian-task [desc]** — Task creation

   - PROCESS: Infers priority (red/yellow/green), due date, linked project
   - OUTPUT: Adds card to correct kanban board column + optional Tasks/ note
   - PROPAGATION: Links from project note + daily note

5. **/obsidian-person [name]** — People notes

6. **/obsidian-decide [topic]** — Decision logging
   - INPUT: Conversation decisions (or filtered by topic)
   - PROCESS: Finds relevant project notes
   - OUTPUT: Appends to project note's Key Decisions section with date
   - PROPAGATION: Logs in daily note, cross-links if multiple projects

7. **/obsidian-capture [idea]** — Idea capture

9. **/obsidian-recap [today|week|month]** — Time period summary
   - INPUT: Date range
   - PROCESS: Spawns parallel subagents (one per daily note in range) + dev logs + kanban tasks
   - OUTPUT: Narrative summary of the period

10. **/obsidian-review** — Structured review generation
    - INPUT: Weekly or monthly (inferred)
    - PROCESS: Reads daily notes, dev logs, active projects, completed tasks
    - OUTPUT: Creates Reviews/YYYY-MM-DD — Weekly Review.md
    - PROPAGATION: Links from last daily note of period

11. **/obsidian-board [name]** — Kanban board management
    - INPUT: Board name (fuzzy matched)
    - PROCESS: Reads board state, identifies overdue items
    - OUTPUT: Displays board + applies updates from conversation

12. **/obsidian-project [name]** — Project note management
    - INPUT: Project name (fuzzy matched)
    - PROCESS: Searches vault, creates or updates
    - OUTPUT: Creates/updates Projects/Project Name.md
    - PROPAGATION: Adds card to kanban board + links from daily note

13. **/obsidian-health** — Vault health audit
    - INPUT: Vault path
    - PROCESS: Runs vault_health.py, spawns 5 parallel subagents (Links, Duplicates, Frontmatter, Staleness, Orphans)
    - OUTPUT: Report grouped by severity (critical/warning/info)

14. **/obsidian-init** — Bootstrap AGENTS.md
    - INPUT: Existing vault
    - PROCESS: Spawns 4 parallel subagents (Dashboard, Templates, Boards, Samples)
    - OUTPUT: Generates AGENTS.md at vault root

---

## Layer 2: Thinking Tools (4 commands)

Purpose: Use vault history to generate insight, challenge assumptions, and surface hidden patterns.

### Commands and Data Flow:

15. **/obsidian-challenge** — Red-team ideas
    - INPUT: User's current claim/plan/assumption
    - PROCESS: Spawns 3 parallel subagents:
      - Decisions agent: searches Key Decisions sections for contradictions
      - Failures agent: searches dev logs, daily notes, archives for past failures
      - Contradictions agent: searches for notes where user held opposite position
    - OUTPUT: Structured "Red Team" analysis with cited vault evidence
    - PROPAGATION: Logs in daily note under Thinking section

16. **/obsidian-emerge** — Pattern detection
    - INPUT: Date range (default: last 30 days)
    - PROCESS: Spawns 4 parallel subagents:
      - Daily notes agent: extracts recurring topics, complaints, energy patterns
      - Dev logs agent: extracts repeated blockers, tools, architectural patterns
      - Decisions agent: looks for directional trends
      - Ideas agent: looks for thematic clusters
    - OUTPUT: Pattern Report — each pattern with evidence, interpretation, suggested action
    - PROPAGATION: Offers to save to Ideas/ + logs in daily note

17. **/obsidian-connect [A] [B]** — Cross-domain bridging
    - INPUT: Two topics/domains
    - PROCESS: For each domain, maps vault cluster (notes, backlinks, outgoing links). Finds shared links, tags, people, or semantic overlap between clusters.
    - OUTPUT: 3-5 concrete connections (structural analogies, transfer opportunities, collision ideas)
    - PROPAGATION: Offers to save to Ideas/ + logs in daily note

18. **/obsidian-graduate** — Idea to project pipeline
    - INPUT: Idea title/tag/keyword
    - PROCESS: Finds idea note, reads linked notes, researches vault for related projects/people/decisions
    - OUTPUT: Full project spec in Projects/ (goals, tasks, phases, open questions, related notes) + kanban board entries
    - PROPAGATION: Updates original idea note (status: graduated) + links from daily note

---

## Layer 3: Context Engine (1 command)

Purpose: Solve the "starting from zero" problem — full session continuity.

### Commands and Data Flow:

19. **/obsidian-world** — Identity and state loader
    - INPUT: None
    - PROCESS: Reads in order:
      1. Identity layer: SOUL.md, CORE_VALUES.md, Home.md/Dashboard.md
      2. Current state: Today's daily note + last 3 daily notes + active kanban boards + previous session digests
      3. Context: Active project notes (status: active) + recently mentioned people (last 7 days)
    - OUTPUT: Concise boot-up status (persona, priorities, open threads, overdue items, today so far)

---

## Layer 4: Scheduled Agents (4 agents, cron-based)

Purpose: Autonomous vault maintenance with zero user intervention.

### Agents:

- **obsidian-morning** — Daily at 8:00 AM
  - Creates today's daily note
  - Pulls overdue/due-today tasks from boards
  - Lists stale active projects (no activity in 7 days)

- **obsidian-nightly** — Daily at 10:00 PM
  - Reads today's daily note
  - Appends End of Day section (3-5 bullet summary)
  - Moves completed kanban tasks to Done column

- **obsidian-weekly** — Fridays at 6:00 PM
  - Runs /obsidian-recap week internally
  - Generates Reviews/YYYY-MM-DD — Weekly Review.md
  - Links from last daily note of the week

- **obsidian-health-check** — Sundays at 9:00 PM
  - Runs vault_health.py
  - Writes health report to Knowledge/
  - Never auto-fixes — report only

---

## Layer 5: Background Agent (PostCompact hook)

Purpose: Silent vault updates during active sessions.

### Flow:
1. User works in Claude Code normally
2. Context compaction occurs (automatic)
3. PostCompact hook fires → obsidian-bg-agent.sh
4. Shell script reads JSON summary from stdin
5. Spawns headless `claude -p` subprocess in vault directory
6. Agent reads AGENTS.md, scans session summary
7. Writes vault updates (people, projects, decisions, tasks, ideas)
8. Exits silently — user sees nothing
9. Log file: /tmp/obsidian-bg-agent.log

Safety: Never deletes, archives, or merges. Only adds or updates.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Search before create** — Never create duplicate notes
2. **Propagate everything** — Every write updates all linked notes (boards, daily note, project notes)
3. **No orphans** — Every note must be linked from somewhere
4. **Fuzzy matching** — All name arguments handle typos
5. **AGENTS.md is the source of truth** — Overrides all defaults
6. **Agents read, humans decide** — Thinking tools present evidence, user makes the call
7. **Vault compounds** — More writing = more context = more powerful AI partner
