# `_CLAUDE.md` Template

`_CLAUDE.md` is a file that lives at the root of your vault.
It is the first thing Claude reads when working in your vault.
It gives every Claude surface (Desktop, Code, VS Code, terminal) the same operating context — no memory required.

---

## How to Generate It

When a user asks Claude to create their `_CLAUDE.md`, Claude should:
1. Call `list_files_in_vault()` to map the vault structure
2. Call `get_file_contents("Home.md")` (or equivalent dashboard) if it exists
3. Call `get_file_contents(path)` on 2–3 templates from the `Templates/` folder
4. Call `get_file_contents(path)` on the current kanban boards
5. Fill in the template below with discovered values
6. Call `append_content("_CLAUDE.md", content)` to write the file to the vault root

---

## The Template

Copy this, fill in the bracketed values, and save as `_CLAUDE.md` in the vault root.

```markdown
# Claude Operating Manual — [Your Name]'s Vault

> Read this file before doing anything in this vault.
> This is the single source of truth for how Claude operates here.

## Auto-Save Rules

Claude should auto-save the following **without asking**:
- Decisions made in conversation → relevant project note + daily note
- New people mentioned → People/ (create stub if needed)
- Tasks assigned or committed to → kanban board + Tasks/ note
- Dev work done → Dev Logs/ + project note + daily note
- Mentions/recognition from colleagues → Mentions Log + person's note
- Completed tasks → move on kanban to ✅ Done

Claude should **ask before saving**:
- Anything touching Finances/ or personal financial data
- Faith/ or Partner/ (private notes)
- Anything that involves deleting or archiving an existing note

---

## Naming Conventions

- Daily notes: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Dev logs: `YYYY-MM-DD — Description.md`
- Deals: `Client Name - Description Month Year.md`
- Tasks: Descriptive title, no date prefix
- People: Full name (e.g. `Jane Smith.md`, not `Jane.md`)
- Archive prefix: `_archived_`

---

## Frontmatter Requirements

Every note must have at minimum:
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
  - [note-type]
---
```

Note types: `daily` | `project` | `task` | `person` | `devlog` | `deal` | `goal` | `mention` | `content`

---

## Kanban Convention

Columns in boards: `📥 Backlog` · `📋 This Week` · `🔨 In Progress` · `⏳ Waiting On` · `✅ Done`

Priority: 🔴 critical · 🟡 important · 🟢 low

Item format:
```
- [ ] 🔴 **Title** · @{YYYY-MM-DD}
	Description. [[Related Project]] [[Person]]
```

Completed:
```
- [x] ~~🔴 **Title**~~ ✅ Date
```

---

## Propagation Rules

| Event | Also update |
|---|---|
| New project | Board (Backlog) + today's daily note |
| Task done | Board (Done, strikethrough) + project note + daily note |
| Dev session | Dev Logs/ + project note (Recent Activity) + daily note |
| Person interaction | Daily note + their People/ note |
| Decision made | Project note (Key Decisions) + daily note |

---

## Do Not Touch

*This file was generated by the obsidian-second-brain skill.*
*Regenerate with: "Claude, update my _CLAUDE.md"*
```

---

## Keeping `_CLAUDE.md` Fresh

`_CLAUDE.md` should be regenerated or updated when:
- A new major project starts
- A team change happens (new manager, new colleagues)
- A folder is restructured
- Active priorities shift significantly

The user can trigger this with: *"Update my `_CLAUDE.md`"* or *"Regenerate my vault manifest."*
