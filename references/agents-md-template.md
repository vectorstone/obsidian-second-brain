# `AGENTS.md` Template

`AGENTS.md` is the primary operating manual at the root of your vault.
Codex reads it automatically when you start work in that vault.
For Claude compatibility, this skill can also generate a matching `_CLAUDE.md` mirror when needed.

---

## How to Generate It

When a user asks the agent to create the vault operating manual, the agent should:
1. Call `list_files_in_vault()` to map the vault structure
2. Call `get_file_contents("Home.md")` (or equivalent dashboard) if it exists
3. Call `get_file_contents(path)` on 2–3 templates from the `Templates/` folder
4. Call `get_file_contents(path)` on the current kanban boards
5. Fill in the template below with discovered values
6. Write `AGENTS.md` to the vault root, and optionally mirror it to `_CLAUDE.md` for Claude compatibility

---

## The Template

Copy this, fill in the bracketed values, and save as `AGENTS.md` in the vault root. If Claude compatibility is needed, also save the same content as `_CLAUDE.md`.

```markdown
# Vault Operating Manual — [Your Name]'s Vault

> Read this file before doing anything in this vault.
> This is the single source of truth for how the agent operates here.

## Section 0 — AI-First Vault Rule (read first, applies to every note)

This vault is designed for future AI-agent retrieval and reasoning, not for human review. The owner may use Codex, Claude, or another capable agent to retrieve, synthesize, and connect dots across years of accumulated knowledge.

**Every note the agent writes to this vault must follow these rules:**

1. **Self-contained context** — Each note must explain itself. Future agent may pull this single note via search with no surrounding context. Don't rely on backlinks alone for meaning.
2. **"For future Claude" preamble** — Every note begins with a 2-3 sentence summary in plain English so Claude can decide relevance in 10 seconds before parsing the structured data.
3. **Rich, consistent frontmatter** — Filterable metadata (`type`, `date`, `topic`, `tags`, `related-people`, `related-projects`, `sources`, `confidence`). Different note types may have different schemas, but every note has machine-readable frontmatter.
4. **Recency markers per claim** — When stating external facts, attach the date: "Mem0 raised $24M (as of 2026-04)" so future-Claude knows what to verify before trusting.
5. **Sources preserved verbatim** — Every external claim has its source URL inline so it can be re-verified or refreshed.
6. **Cross-links are mandatory** — Every person, project, idea, decision, or concept referenced uses `[[wikilinks]]` so the graph is traversable.
7. **Confidence levels** — Where applicable, mark claims as `stated | high | medium | speculation` so future-Claude knows what to trust vs verify.

This rule applies to all `/obsidian-*` and `/research*` commands, all scheduled agents, and any direct vault writes.

## Key Files

- **Dashboard:** `[[Home]]` — main navigation and dataview queries
- **Work Board:** `[[Boards/[Work Board Name]]]`
- **Personal Board:** `[[Boards/Personal]]`
- **Mentions Log:** `[[Mentions/Mentions Log]]`
- **People Index:** `People/` folder

---

## Active Context

> Update this section at the start of each major project or focus period.

**Current top priority:** [Your current top priority here]
**Current job:** [Company] — [Your Role]
**Manager:** [Name]
**Key colleagues:** [Name (role), Name (role), ...]

---

## Auto-Save Rules

The agent should auto-save the following **without asking**:
- Decisions made in conversation → relevant project note + daily note
- New people mentioned → People/ (create stub if needed)
- Tasks assigned or committed to → kanban board + Tasks/ note
- Dev work done → Dev Logs/ + project note + daily note
- Mentions/recognition from colleagues → Mentions Log + person's note
- Completed tasks → move on kanban to ✅ Done

The agent should **ask before saving**:
- Anything touching Finances/ or personal financial data
- Faith/ or Partner/ (private notes)
- Anything that involves deleting or archiving an existing note

---

## Naming Conventions

- Daily notes: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Dev logs: `YYYY-MM-DD — Description.md`
- Deals: `Client Name - Description Month Year.md`
- Tasks: Descriptive title, no date prefix
- People: Full name (e.g. `Jane Smith.md`, not `Jane.md`)
- Archive prefix: `_archived_`

---

## Frontmatter Requirements

Every note must have at minimum:
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
  - [note-type]
---
```

Note types: `daily` | `project` | `task` | `person` | `devlog` | `deal` | `goal` | `mention` | `content`

---

## Kanban Convention

Columns in boards: `📥 Backlog` · `📋 This Week` · `🔨 In Progress` · `⏳ Waiting On` · `✅ Done`

Priority: 🔴 critical · 🟡 important · 🟢 low

Item format:
```
- [ ] 🔴 **Title** · @{YYYY-MM-DD}
	Description. [[Related Project]] [[Person]]
```

Completed:
```
- [x] ~~🔴 **Title**~~ ✅ Date
```

---

## Propagation Rules

| Event | Also update |
|---|---|
| New project | Board (Backlog) + today's daily note |
| Task done | Board (Done, strikethrough) + project note + daily note |
| Dev session | Dev Logs/ + project note (Recent Activity) + daily note |
| Person interaction | Daily note + their People/ note |
| Decision made | Project note (Key Decisions) + daily note |
| Mention/recognition | Mentions Log + person's note + daily note |
| Deal update | Deal file + Side Biz board + daily note |

---

## People to Know

> Add the people most relevant to your work here so Claude doesn't have to discover them.

| Person | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Name] | [Role] | [One-line context] |
| [Name] | [Role] | [One-line context] |

---

## Projects Currently Active

> Keep this list current. The agent uses it to route context correctly.

- `[[Projects/Project Name]]` — [one-line status]
- `[[Projects/Project Name]]` — [one-line status]

---

## Do Not Touch

- `Templates/` — Never modify templates during normal vault operations
- `Faith/` — Private. Read only if directly asked.
- `[Other private folders]` — [Reason]

---

*This file was generated by the obsidian-second-brain skill.*
*Regenerate with: "Claude, update my _CLAUDE.md"*
```

---

## Keeping `AGENTS.md` Fresh

`AGENTS.md` should be regenerated or updated when:
- A new major project starts
- A team change happens (new manager, new colleagues)
- A folder is restructured
- Active priorities shift significantly

The user can trigger this with: *"Update my `AGENTS.md`"* or *"Regenerate my vault operating manual."*
